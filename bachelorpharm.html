<p>A Bachelor of Pharmacy (abbreviated BPharm) is an undergraduate
 academic degree in the field of pharmacy. The degree is the basic 
prerequisite for registration to practice as a pharmacist in many countries.
 In some countries, it has been superseded by the Master of Pharmacy
 (MPharm) and Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degrees. In the United States,
 this degree was granted as the baccalaureate pharmacy degree only at 
Washington State University, where it has now been superseded by the
 PharmD degree. The degree previously offered within the US—and still 
the required degree in Canada—is the Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy.</p>

<p>The Bachelor of Pharmacy degree is popularly known as B-Pharm in India. 
It is a four-year program with both annual and semester schemes available. In 
order to be eligible, one must pass with at least 50% marks in 10 + 2 (or an 
equivqlent examination) with biology/biotechnology as one of the subjects. 
In some states it is mandatory to give an additional pharmacy entrance examination
 in order to be eligible for the course. D.Pharm (Diploma of Pharmacy) holders are 
eligible for admission into B.Pharm (Bachelor of Pharmacy) into the second year 
directly via Lateral entry.</p>

<p>Colleges imparting pharmaceutical education (D.Pharm, B.Pharm, M.Pharm or Pharm D) 
must be approved by All Indian Council of Technical Education (AICTE) or Pharmacy 
Council Of India (PCI).For a student to be eligible for registration as a pharmacist in India, 
the college from which he/she graduated must be approved by the PCI. B-Pharm is often 
superseded by M-Pharm and PhD level courses although the minimum qualification required
for registration as a pharmacist is D.Pharm.</p>

Nims Institute of Pharmacy, Nims College of Pharmacy, NIMS University, Shobha Nagar, 
Jaipur-303121</p>

<p>Though NIPER is not recognized by PCI but it is sometime called "Heaven" by pharmacy
 graduates due to its quality of education and research. It is an autonomous body created 
by a special Act of Indian Parliament. Every year, entrance examinations are conducted 
for admission to post-graduation and PhD courses at NIPER. NIPER S.A.S. Nagar is 
considered the best of pharmacy institute in India.The information sharing between 
B.Pharm students is important for their growth & the need,which was recently was fulfilled 
by pharmacist unions all over India as PharmaCloud.</p>
