<p>A Bachelor of Science (Bc., B.S., BS, B.Sc. or BSc; less commonly, 
S.B., SB, or Sc.B. from the Latin Scientiæ Baccalaureus) or a 
Science Degree is an undergraduate academic degree awarded for
 completed courses that generally last three to five years.</p>

<p>Whether a subject is considered a science or an art can vary between
 universities. For example, an economics degree may be given as a
 Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) by one university but as a B.Sc. by another.
 Biology, biochemistry, mathematics, physics, chemistry, social science,
 sport/exercise science, general science, earth science, computer 
science and the various fields of engineering are almost universally
 considered to be sciences.</p>

<p>Even in cases of near-unilateral consensus across a country as to
 whether a subject is a science or an art, there are exceptions.
 Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service awards Bachelor 
of Science in Foreign Service degrees to all of its undergraduates,
 although many of them major in humanities-oriented fields such as 
international history and culture and politics. The London School of 
Economics offers B.Sc. degrees in practically all subject areas, 
even those normally associated with arts degrees, while the Oxbridge 
universities almost exclusively award arts qualifications. In both 
instances, there are historical and traditional reasons. Northwestern
 University's School of Communication grants B.Sc. degrees in all of 
its programs of study, including theater, dance, and radio/television/film.</p>

<p>The first university to admit a student to the degree of Bachelor of 
Science was the University of London in 1860. Prior to this, science
subjects were included in the B.A. bracket, notably in the cases of 
mathematics, physics, physiology and botany.</p>
