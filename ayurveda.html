<p>Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (B.A.M.S.) (abbreviated in various ways,
 viz. BAMS, BUMS, MBBS (Ayurveda) etc.), is the first professional undergraduate degree
 awarded after the study of five and a half years duration, including 1 year internship. 
The curriculum includes studying and teaching of modern anatomy, physiology, principles
 of medicine, preventive and social medicine, pharmacology, toxicology, forensic medicine,
 ENT, Ophthalmology, principles of surgery, etc. along with ayurvedic topics.</p>Some 
experts opine that in future there is possibility of integration of BAMS and MBBS courses</p>
<p>A BAMS doctor can work in following domains after completion of the degree.</p>
<p>A BAMS graduate can practice modern / allopathic medicine in the Indian state of 
Maharashtra. Many people are unaware of this fact that BAMS doctors can practice 
modern / allopatic medicine. According to the privileges in the Drugs & Cosmetics
 Act 1940,Rules 1945 Sec 2ee(iii), States have right to allow BAMS doctors to use
 modern medicine, in the practice.</p>
<p>One study conducted by Words Health Organization claims although the prescribing 
patterns of both MBBS as well as BAMS doctors are not satisfactory; the BAMS
 doctors seem to prescribe more irrationally as compared to MBBS doctors.The study
 also concluded that additional training on allopathy pharmacology will help governments
 to better use services of BAMS doctors in the field of modern medicine.</p>
<p>Most of the BAMS syllabus covers subjects included in MBBS. Duration of the course,
clinical and practical training patters also shows similarities.</p>
