<p>Microbiology is a broad science encompassing the study of bacteria,
 algae, protozoa, fungi, and viruses in terms of their ecology, 
biochemistry, physiology, genetics, and role in disease processes.
 Of particular interest is the use of microbes in industrial applications
 for the production of foods and natural products, such as vitamins,
 as well as their rapidly expanding role in biotechnology and genetic 
engineering studies. </p>

<p>A thorough understanding of microorganisms 
requires a broad educational background, not only in microbiology, 
but also in chemistry, physics, mathematics, and other areas of biology.
 Within the undergraduate program, the student may choose to 
mphasize either the areas of general microbiology or medical 
microbiology. At the completion of the appropriate coursework, 
individuals are qualified to enter laboratory positions in private 
industry or government, such as those listed under Career Options.</p>

<p>Completion of the Bachelor of Science in Biology with a concentration
 in Microbiology may also allow the student to continue into more 
specialized and in-depth advanced study leading to the Master of Arts 
degree in Biology with a concentration in Microbiology. The breadth of 
interests and expertise of the faculty includes environmental microbiology,
 microbial genetics, genetic engineering, immunology and 
immunochemistry, medical microbiology, mycology, protozoology,
 virology and microbia physiology, and biochemistry. Therefore, a wide 
variety of research areas is available for investigation by students.</p>

 <p>Opportunities provided by the additional educational training of the 
master's degree include those listed under "Career Options," various 
supervisory positions, and entry into Ph.D. programs at other universities.
 In the San Francisco Bay Area our most recent graduates have been hired
 as quality control microbiologists or as research technicians and associates
 in hospitals, government laboratories, and private industry, including those
 specializing in genetic engineering. It is possible for a student majoring in
 microbiology to pursue a career in medical technology, but additional
 coursework is required, as well as completion of a one-year postgraduate
 training program in an approved laboratory. Consult the microbiology
 advisor to design the appropriate course plan for clinical science.</p>

<p>The programs in Microbiology have specific requirements for lower-division 
and upper-division core courses. Entering students are advised to consult 
with the Microbiology faculty advisor before selecting their coursework. In 
general, lower-division courses may be taken at community colleges.</p>
