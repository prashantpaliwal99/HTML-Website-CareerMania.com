<p>Chartered Accountants were the first accountants to form a 
professional accounting body, initially established in Britain in 
1854. The Edinburgh Society of Accountants (formed 1854), 
the Glasgow Institute of Accountants and Actuaries (1854) and
 the Aberdeen Society of Accountants (1867) were each 
granted a royal charter almost from their inception. The title
 is an internationally recognised professional designation.</p>

<p>Chartered Accountants work in all fields of business and 
finance, including audit, taxation, financial and general 
management. Some are engaged in public practice work,
 others work in the private sector and some are employed
 by government bodies.</p>

<p>Chartered Accountants' institutes require members to 
undertake a minimum level of continuing professional 
development to stay professionally competitive. They 
facilitate special interest groups (for instance, 
entertainment and media, or insolvency and restructuring)
 which lead in their fields. They provide support to
 members by offering advisory services, technical helplines
 and technical libraries. They also offer opportunities for
 professional networking and career and business development.
In India, Chartered Accountants are regulated by the Institute
 of Chartered Accountants of India which was established by 
the Chartered Accountants Act 1949. Prior to 1949, Restricted
 State Auditors were registered with the respective princely 
states and British provincial state governments.</p>

<p>Associate members of the ICAI are entitled to use the prefix
 'CA' to their name. Members who are in full-time practice, and 
have completed 5 years of practice, can add 'FCA' as  prefix
 to their names.</p>

<p>As of December 2013, ICAI had more than 240,000 registered members.
Entry to the profession can be by taking the CPT after completion
 of schooling (12th grade). Alternatively, graduates may take the 
Intermediate exam.</p>

<p>The intermediate examination is divided into two groups of subjects.
 On clearing the first group of IPC level, the student has to work as
 an articled assistant for two years in a Chartered firm and a third 
year of training in any industry before taking the final exam.</p>

<p>For overall development, the student has to undergo a soft skill and 
communication training named GMCS, which usually lasts for fifteen
 days. A comprehensive 100 hours training on Information Technology
 is also conducted to keep students up-to-date.</p>
