<p>A Bachelor of Information Technology (abbreviations BIT, 
BInfTech, B.Tech(IT) or BE(IT)) is an undergraduate academic 
degree that generally requires three to five years of study.
 While the degree has a major focus on computers and
 technology, it differs from a Computer Science degree in that
 students are also expected to study management and information
 science, and there are reduced requirements for mathematics.</p>
 
<p>A degree in computer science can be expected to concentrate
 on the scientific aspects of computing, while a degree in 
information technology can be expected to concentrate on the
business and communication applications of computing. 
There is more emphasis on these two areas in the e-commerce,
 e-business and business information technology undergraduate
 courses. Specific names for the degrees vary across countries,
 and even universities within countries.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to a Bachelor of Science in Information 
Technology which is a bachelor's degree typically conferred after
 a period of three to four years of an undergraduate course of study
 in Information Technology (IT). The degree itself is a Bachelor of 
Science with institutions conferring degrees in the fields of information
 technology and related fields.</p>

<p>In India, Bachelor of Information Technology is a 4 year undergraduate
course. Course is divided into 8-semesters,the degree is awarded 
after completion of a 4 year program. The degree is conferred by 
government and private institutions, as well as a host of other
 prestigious institutes (both public and privately funded) for their 
professional engineering programs. However, most other institutions
 in India use the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) / Bachelors of
 Engineering (BE)in IT degree.Admission the program is done through
 nation-wide entrance test. There is also a 3-year course which awards
 a B.Sc. degree at the end of the program. Some universities even offer
 a B.Sc. IT course either through regular programs or through 
distance-learning courses. However there is not much demand to the 
B.Sc. course as it is to the B.Tech or B.E IT courses.</p>
