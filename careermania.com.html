<p>Many students don't have much time to spend in career planning during their degree course.
 You may be too busy working to earn money to pay your way through university, or perhaps you
 are a mature student with a young family that you need to support. You may be too busy to 
regularly visit the Careers Service. This page will allow you to do much of this career planning 
via the web</p>
<p><h2>Choosing a career involves 4 main stages:</h2>
1.)Self Awareness<br>
2.)Opportunity Awareness<br>
3.)Decision Making<br>
4.)Taking Action<br>
Sometimes these stages will overlap and sometimes you have to return to a previous stage. 
Be aware the cycle is not always as linear and consistent as it is presented here.</p>
<p><h3>1.)Self Awareness</h3>
The first stage of Career Choice is Self Awareness. This involves looking at your SKILLS, 
VALUES, INTERESTS and PERSONALITY and analysing where your strengths and weaknesses
 lie. This is important both in choosing the right career and also for success in applications and
 interviews where you will find many questions which test whether you have been through this process.

You can start with looking at your SKILLS here. You can now also look at your INTERESTS , VALUES
 and PERSONAL STYLES on the web.</p>
<p><h3>2.)Opportunity Awareness</h3>Once you have done some preliminary self analysis, the next
 stage is to gather information on the opportunities open to you. There is a range of resources to help 
you here:</p>
<img src="aaaa.gif" alt ="career" align="right" height="250" width="500">
<p><b>There is a range of general careers talks each term which are listed here:-</b></p>
<p>There may also be specific careers education programmes for your degree subject, usually during your 
second year of study</p>

<p><b>Information on what you can do with your degree subject:-</b></p>
<p>Many jobs are open to graduates of any degree subject, and it's important not to only focus on the jobs
 related to your degree, but if you are doing a vocational degree, or simply want to find out what previous
 Kent graduates in your subject have gone on to do, the following resources should help.
Early in your course you should look at the Work Experience open to you. As well as allowing you to earn 
money, they may allow you to gain relevant skills and perhaps an insight into the types of job you are 
interested in, putting you at the head of the queue when you eventually apply for jobs.

The Careers Information Room has a wide variety of booklets, reference files, books, DVD's and computer 
programmes you can use.

You may like to enter Postgraduate Study instead of directly entering a job, or it may be required for a particular
 career such as law or teaching. Here it may be important to apply early in your final year and to look at whether 
funding will be available to pay for the course.</p>

<p><h3>3.)Decision Making</h3></p>
<p>The computer programs below allow you to put in a number of factors on what you want in a career (such as 
helping others, promotion prospects) and will give suggestions of possible careers which might match these. 
Regard these as useful suggestions rather than gospel truth, but they should bring up some possibilities that you 
haven't considered before.

Prospects Planner www.prospects.ac.uk/links/Pplanner is a powerful program to help you choose a graduate
 career. It allows you to answer questions about your values and interests and then to relate these to a database 
of hundreds of occupations to get suggestions on appropriate careers.

Alternatively Careers Explorer is a quick and simple program which will also suggest graduate careers

Talk to graduates already working in your chosen career area. You can use the Kent Alumni Careers Network to 
contact a graduate directly. Work shadowing (spending a day with) a person in the career you are considering 
is the next best thing to actually doing a job, to find out what it is like. If you have done this, you will come across
as much better prepared at interviews.Of course, the other important part in making decisions is discussing it with
other people. Friends, family and tutors can all play an important part here . The Duty Careers Adviser is available
every day without an appointment for a short discussion and can often help to inject reality into your ideas for
example, pointing out that you may need to fund your way through a postgraduate course to enter your chosen 
career.</p>
<p><h3>Taking Action</h3></p>
<p>This is the final process of career planning. It involves:<br>

1.)Finding out about the EMPLOYERS that offer the types of jobs you are interested in.<br>
2.)Search our VACANCY DATABASE<br>
3.)Preparing APPLICATIONS and attending INTERVIEWS<br>
4.)Perhaps taking APTITUDE TESTS and attending SELECTION CENTRES<br>
 

First look at the Timeline, which gives you an idea of what you should be doing when during your time at UKC in 
terms of Career Planning.Sometimes you may have to return to previous stages in the process, for example, if 
you are not able to get into your first choice career</p>
