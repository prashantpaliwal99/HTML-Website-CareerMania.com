<p>A holistic input on generic design with more focused 
approach towards apparel inculcates the ability to develop
 and channelise creativity. The Fashion Design specialisation
 offered by the Department of Fashion & Apparel hones 
design sensitisation, which balances global fashion aesthetics
 with an Indian soul. It addresses needs of the export
 market as well as both couture and pret a porter clothing

 niche segments. In tandem with the shifts in the industry
 where Design has become even more significant, the 
students are trained to anticipate and address relevant 
concerns and issues. A logical, sequential, hands-on experience
 enables students to conceptualise designs, make patterns, 
drape and construct garments of impeccable quality.</p>
