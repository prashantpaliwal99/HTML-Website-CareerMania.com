<p>A Bachelor of Commerce (abbreviated BCom, B.Com., BComm, or B.Comm.)
 is an undergraduate degree in commerce and related subjects. The degree is also
known as the Bachelor of Commerce and Administration, or BCA. It is predominantly
 offered in Commonwealth nations; however, the degree is no longer offered in the
United Kingdom. It is generally offered as a full-time, three- or four-year program.</p>

<b>Curriculum</b><br>
<b>Bachelor of Commerce</b><br>
<p>The Bachelor of Commerce degree is designed to provide the student with a
 wide range of managerial skills while at the same time building competence in a 
particular area of business studies; see below. Most universities therefore plan 
the degree such that additional to their major, students are exposed to general 
business principles, taking courses in accounting/finance, human resources, 
statistics, marketing, economics, and information systems. For a comparison 
with other degrees in business and management, see further under Business 
education.</p>

<b>Honours Bachelor of Commerce</b><br>
<p>The Honours Bachelor of Commerce (H.B.Comm. or BCom (Hons)) is a four-year
 commerce degree. It may consist of a four-year program, or of a single-year
 program taken subsequent to the three year Bachelor's degree. The degree
requires additional academic courses, with a researched thesis component, and 
is an abridgement between the undergraduate program and postgraduate programs,
 including the Master of Commerce and Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) 
degrees. The one-year program is often focused exclusively on a single subject-area.</p>
<b>Areas of study</b><br>
<p>Depending on the institution, a formal academic major may or may not be established.
 Regardless, the Bachelor of Commerce requires students to take the majority of their
 courses in business-related subjects, namely the following and others depending on 
students' particular interests.</p>
