<h3>BA LLB - Bachelor of arts and Bachelor of Law</h3>
<p>If you want to become a law graduate, there are essentially
 two routes that are available for you. One is to take up the
 5 years integrated BA LLB or to take up 3 years LLB after 
completing graduation in any stream. Here we are comparing
 the two options so that the takers can make an informed 
decision.</p>
 
<b>Duration:</b>
 
<p>Both these courses lead to a law degree eventually but LLB
 after graduation takes in all 6 years; therefore many students
 opt for integrated BA LLB to save 1 year.</p>
 
<b>Option to opt out after 3 years</b>
 
<p>Well, integrated course really makes sense for those students
 if they are 100% sure that they want to continue only in this 
particular field, that is the field of Law. This is so because 
after completing 3 years generally the option to get out is not 
there in most of the integrated courses, so essentially, if one
 opts for this option then one has to complete this.</p>
 
<b>Worry of choosing the course again</b>
 
<p>Usually the students have to face two dilemmas; the first one
 is when one has to choose an option after 12th.  The second
 dilemma comes after completion of the Graduate course. So
 a big advantage of getting into an integrated BA LLB course
 is that one is free from the worry of choosing a college and 
course again after 3 years. This is not the case with those who
 are doing a normal graduation course.
 But if you are the one who is not fully sure that career in law 
is for you (you can know whether law is suitable for you or not
 by simply taking the MapMyTalent Assessment) or want to keep
 the option of other professional or higher education options for
 yourself, then perhaps, a 3 year graduation course would be a
 good option for you.</p>
 
<b>Availability of seats in reputed College/ University</b>
 
<p>There are many reputed National Law Universities that offer only
 integrated BA LLB course and then LLM or PG Diploma courses. 
So there are many seats for 5 years Integrated Course. Other 
than NLU’s many other universities like Punjab University, AMU, 
IP University Delhi,  etc also offer BA LLB Course.
On the other hand LLB is offered at many prestigious central and
 state universities like Delhi University, Punjab University, BHU, 
Government law College Mumbai, Bharati Vidyapith, 
Dr Harisingh Gaur University, MP, Punjabi University,
Indian Law Society’s Law College in Pune,  Rajasthan University,
 Law college Dehradun  etc., So a large number of seats are available.
Also if you have taken admission in a 5 year BA LLB then you have a
 seat guarantee for 5 years that is you don’t have again look for a seat
 for admission after graduation.</p>
 
<b>Syllabus</b>
 
<p>As far as syllabus ( Ref Punjab University Syllabus for BA LLB) is 
concerned since BA LLB is integrated course the students study law 
papers right from the first semester onwards like Law of Torts, Consumer
 Protection Laws, Law of contract etc. These law related papers and English
 is compulsory but the students can choose papers form Political science,
 History, economics, sociology etc. 
In the second semester they study Jurisprudence and Special contracts. 
Like that in every semester there are some papers from the Law field. 
After 3 years, that is 7th semester onwards the BA papers are taken as
 major and minor and there are other papers of law like Business law, 
international law etc.
As far as syllabus of LLB is concerned the students takes up LLB after
 they have already completed their graduation and the course only includes
 courses from law Jurisprudence, Constitutional Law, Law of contracts,
 Family Law , Law of crimes etc.
Both the courses include summer training and also the students attend court.</p>
 
<b>Degree</b>
 
<p>In BA LLB after 5 years the student gets two degrees one for BA and 
another for LLB. While in LLB he gets the degree of LLB.</p>

<b>Variants</b>
 
<p>The 5 year integrated LLB degree now has many variants also like there are
 B.Com LLB, B.Sc LLB and BBA LLB is also available. Just like BA LLB 
integrates Arts subjects with Law the other courses integrate the subjects 
from the respective fields with law courses.</p>
